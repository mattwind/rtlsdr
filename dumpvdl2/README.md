### Installation

Install necessary dependencies (unless you have them already). Example for Debian / Raspbian:

        sudo apt-get install gcc make libtool libglib2.0-dev pkg-config

##### RTLSDR support (optional)

Install `librtlsdr` library (unless you have it already). Under Raspbian you can install packaged version:

        apt-get install librtlsdr-dev

or get the source from Git and compile by yourself:

        apt-get install git autoconf libusb-1.0-0-dev
        cd
        git clone git://git.osmocom.org/rtl-sdr.git
        cd rtl-sdr/
        autoreconf -i
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig
        sudo cp $HOME/rtl-sdr/rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/rtl-sdr.rules

##### Mirics support (optional)

Mirics support is based on open-source libmirisdr-4 library. Use it if you have a DVB-T
receiver based on this chipset. SDRPlay RSP will also work (it's based on Mirics, after all),
however if you have SDRPlay, it's probably better to use native closed-source driver
instead (see next section). It supports more configuration options and reportedly gives
better results on this hardware.

Install `libmirisdr-4` library:

	apt-get install git cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev
        cd
        git clone https://github.com/f4exb/libmirisdr-4.git
        cd libmirisdr-4
        ./build.sh
        cd build
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig
        sudo cp $HOME/libmirisdr-4/mirisdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/mirisdr.rules

##### SDRPLAY RSP1/2 support (optional)

Download and install API/hardware driver package from http://www.sdrplay.com/downloads/.
Make sure you have selected the right hardware platform before downloading, otherwise
the installer will fail.

##### Compiling dumpvdl2

Clone the dumpvdl2 repository:

        git clone https://github.com/szpajder/dumpvdl2.git
        cd dumpvdl2

If you only need RTLSDR support, it is enabled by default, so just type:

        make

Mirics support has to be explicitly enabled, like this:

        make WITH_MIRISDR=1

If you want Mirics only, you may disable RTLSDR support:

        make WITH_MIRISDR=1 WITH_RTLSDR=0

If you want SDRPLAY RSP1/2 only, you may disable RTLSDR support:

        make WITH_SDRPLAY=1 WITH_RTLSDR=0

**Note:** every time you decide to recompile with different `WITH_*` or `USE_*` options,
clean the old build first using `make clean`.

For available command line options, run:

        ./dumpvdl2 --help

##### Optional: add support for statistics

Install `statsd-c-client` library from https://github.com/romanbsd/statsd-c-client:

        git clone https://github.com/romanbsd/statsd-c-client.git
        cd statsd-c-client
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo ldconfig

Compile dumpvdl2 as above, but add `USE_STATSD=1`:

        make USE_STATSD=1

### Basic usage

##### RTL-SDR

Simpliest case on RTLSDR dongle - uses RTL device with index 0, sets the tuner gain to
40 dB and tuning correction to 42 ppm, listens to the default VDL2 frequency of 136.975 MHz,
outputs to standard output:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 0 --gain 40 --correction 42

Device ID numbers are not persistent - they depend on the USB device order and the sequence
which they were plugged in. You may specify the device by its serial number to get deterministic
behavior:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 771111153 --gain 40 --correction 42

Use rtl_test utility to get serial numbers of your devices. dumpvdl2 will print them to
the screen on startup as well.

If you want to listen to a different VDL2 channel, just give its frequency as a last parameter:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 0 --gain 40 --correction 42 136725000

dumpvdl2 can decode up to 8 VDL2 channels simultaneously. Just add them at the end:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 0 --gain 40 --correction 42 136725000 136975000 136875000

If your receiver has a large DC spike, you can set the center frequency a bit to the side
of the desired channel frequency, like this:

        ./dumpvdl2 --rtlsdr 0 --gain 40 --correction 42 --centerfreq 136955000

##### Mirics

Mirics is similar, however `libmirisdr-4` library currently lacks support for configuring
correction in ppm. If your receiver needs a non-zero correction, you can pass the appropriate
value in Hertz, instead of ppm. **Note:** this value will be subtracted from the center
frequency, so if your receiver tunes a bit too low, the parameter value shall be negative:

        ./dumpvdl2 --mirisdr 0 --gain 100 --correction -2500

Device serial number can be given instead of ID, the same way, as for RTLSDR receivers.

`libmirisdr-4` supports two types of hardware: generic Mirics (0 - the default) and SDRPlay (1).
SDRPlay users should add `--hw-type 1` option. It uses frequency plans optimized for SDRPlay
and reportedly gives better results than the default mode.

If you get error messages about lost samples on Raspberry Pi, try adding `--usb-mode 1`.
This switches USB transfer mode from isochronous to bulk, which is usually enough to rectify
this problem. If it does not help, it might be that your Pi is overloaded or not beefy enough
for the task.

##### SDRPLAY RSP1/2 Native

SDRPlay RSP native driver supports several advanced configuration options:

- switching antenna ports,
- bias-t
- notch filter on AM/FM
- AGC

Type `./dumpvdl2 --help` to find out all the options and their default values.

Example: start the program with antenna A selection, bias-t off and notch filter on:

        ./dumpvdl2 --sdrplay 0 --gain 80 --antenna A --biast 0 --notch-filter 1 136975000

### Output options

- Decoded messages are printed to standard output by default. You can direct them to a
  disk file instead:

        ./dumpvdl2 --output-file vdl2.log [other_options]

- If you want the file to be automatically rotated on top of every hour, add `--hourly` option.
  The file name will be appended with `_YYYYMMDDHH` suffix. If file extension is present, it
  will be placed after the suffix.

- If you prefer daily rotation, `--daily` option does just that. The file name suffix will be
  `_YYYYMMDD` in this case. If file extension is present, it will be placed after the suffix.

- Add `--utc` option if you prefer UTC timestamps rather than local timezone in output and filenames.

- Add `--raw-frames` option to display payload of AVLC frames in raw hex for debugging purposes.

### Integration with Planeplotter

dumpvdl2 can send ACARS messages to Planeplotter, which in turn can extract aircraft position
information from them and display blips on the map. First, configure your Planeplotter as follows:

- Stop data processing (press 'Stop' button on the toolbar)

- Go to Options / I/O Settings...

- Tick 'UDP/IP Data from net'

- Set 'UDP/IP local port' to some value (default is 9742)

- Close the settings window by clicking OK and restart data processing

Supply dumpvdl2 with the address (or host name) and port where the Planeplotter is listening:

        ./dumpvdl2 --output-acars-pp 10.10.10.12:9742 [other_options]

That's all. Switch to 'Message view' in Planeplotter and look for incoming messages.

### Message filtering

By default dumpvdl2 logs all decoded messages. You can use `--msg-filter` option to ignore
things you don't want to see. If you do not want messages sent by ground stations, run
the program like this:

        ./dumpvdl2 --msg-filter all,-uplink [other_options]

Or if you want to filter out empty ACARS messages, because they are boring, use this:

        ./dumpvdl2 --msg-filter all,-acars_nodata [other_options]

For full list of supported filtering options, run:

        ./dumpvdl2 --msg-filter help

Refer to `FILTERING_EXAMPLES.md` file for more examples and details.

### Statistics

The program does not calculate statistics by itself. Instead, it sends metric values (mostly
counters) to the external collector using Etsy StatsD protocol. It's the collector's job
to receive, aggregate, store and graph them. Some examples of software which can be used
for this purpose:

- [Collectd](https://collectd.org/) is a statistics collection daemon which supports a lot of
  metric sources by using various [plugins](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins).
  It has a [StatsD](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:StatsD) plugin which can receive
  statistics emitted by dumpvdl2, aggregate them and write to various time-series databases
  like RRD, Graphite, MongoDB or TSDB.

- [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) is a time-series database with powerful analytics and
  aggregation functions. Its graphing engine is quite basic, though.

- [Grafana](http://grafana.org/) is a sophisticated and elegant graphing solution supporting
  a variety of data sources.

Here is an example of some dumpvdl2 metrics being graphed by Grafana:

![Statistics](statistics.png?raw=true)

Metrics are quite handy when tuning the antenna installation or receiving parameters (like gain
or correction). Full list of currently supported counters can be found in `statsd.c` source file.
dumpvdl2 produces a separate set of counters for each configured VDL2 channel.

To enable statistics just give dumpvdl2 your StatsD collector's hostname (or IP address)
and UDP port number, for example:

        ./dumpvdl2 --statsd 10.10.10.15:1234 [other_options]

### Processing recorded IQ data from file

The syntax is:
```
dumpvdl2 --iq-file <file_name> [--sample-format <sample_format>] [--oversample <oversample_rate>]
  [--centerfreq <center_frequency>] [vdl_freq_1] [vdl_freq_2] [...]
```
The symbol rate for VDL2 is 10500 symbols/sec. dumpvdl2 internal processing rate is 10 samples
per symbol. Therefore the file must be recorded with sampling rate set to an integer multiple
of 105000. Specify the multiplier value with `--oversample` option. The default value is 10, which is
valid for files sampled as 1050000 samples/sec. For example, if you have recorded your file at
2100000 samples/sec, then use `--oversample 20` (because 105000 * 20 = 2100000).

The program accepts raw data files without any header. Files produced by `rtl_sdr` and `miri_sdr`
programs are perfectly valid input files. Different radios produce samples in different formats,
though. dumpvdl2 currently supports following sample formats:

- `U8` - unsigned 8-bit samples. This is the format produced by `rtl_sdr` utility.
- `S16_LE` - 16-bit signed, little endian. Produced by `miri_sdr` utility (by default).

Use `--sample-format` option to set the format. The default format is `U8`.

The program assumes that the VDL2 channel is located at baseband (0 Hz), ie. the center
frequency of your radio was set to the VDL2 channel frequency during recording. If this is not
the case, you have to provide correct center frequency and channel frequency. For example, if your
receiver was tuned to 136.955 MHz during recording and you want to decode the VDL2 channel
located at 136.975 MHz, then use this:

        dumpvdl2 --iq-file <file_name> --centerfreq 136955000 136975000

Putting it all together:

```
dumpvdl2 --iq-file iq.dat --sample-format S16_LE --oversample 13 --centerfreq 136955000 136975000 136725000
```

processes `iq.dat` file recorded at 1365000 samples/sec using 16-bit signed samples, with receiver
center frequency set to 136.955 MHz. VDL2 channels located at 136.975 and 136.725 MHz will be decoded.

### Frequently Asked Questions

##### What is VDL Mode 2?

VDL (VHF Data Link) Mode 2 is a communication protocol between aircraft and a network of ground
stations. It has a higher capacity than ACARS and a lot more applications. More information
can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHF_Data_Link) or
[SigIdWiki](http://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/VHF_Data_Link_-_Mode_2_(VDL-M2)).

##### Who uses it?

Civil airlines - not all, but many. Military? Umm, no.

##### What frequencies it runs on?

The most ubiquitous is 136.975 MHz (so called Common Signalling Channel). In some areas where
the capacity of a single channel is not enough, 136.725, 136.775 or 136.875 is used as well.
Because they are closely spaced, dumpvdl2 can receive all of them simultaneously with a single
receiver.

##### Is it used in my area?

Yup, it's quite probable. Launch your favorite SDR Console (like SDRSharp or GQRX), tune
136.975 MHz and place your antenna outside (or near the window, at least). If you see short
bursts every now and then, it's there.

##### What antenna shall I use?

VDL2 runs on VHF airband, so if you already have a dedicated antenna for ACARS or airband voice,
it will be perfect for VDL2. However VDL2 transmissions are not very powerful, so do not expect
thousands of messages per hour, if your antenna is located indoors. If you have already played
with ADS-B, you know, what to do - put the antenna outside and high with unobstructed sky view,
use short and good quality feeder cable, shield your radio from external RF interference.

##### Two hours straight and zero messages received. What's wrong?

It basically comes down to three things:

###### The signal has to be strong enough (preferably 20 dB over noise floor, or better)

- set your tuner gain quite high. I get good results with 40 dB for RTLSDR and 100 dB for Mirics
  dongles. 75-85 dB is reported to work well on SDRPlay. However, it depends on the used antenna.
  But do not be tempted to crank the gain up to the max. Keep your noise floor as low as possible,
  because higher noise yields higher bit error rate.

- check SDR Console with the same gain setting - do you see data bursts clearly? (they are
  very short, like pops).

- if your DC spike is very high, set the center frequency manually to dodge it (use `--centerfreq`
  option).

- RTL dongles are cheap - some of them have higher noise figure than others. If you have several
  dongles at hand, just try another one.

To verify that the signal strength is enough for the squelch to open, do the following:

- Go to dumpvdl2 source directory

- Recompile with debug output enabled:

        make clean
        make <your_make_options> DEBUG=1

- Run the program as usual. It will display debugging info to standard error. Every second or so
  the current noise floor estimate for each configured channel will be printed:
```
process_samples(): 136975000: noise_floor: -43.8 dBFS
process_samples(): 136975000: noise_floor: -42.1 dBFS
process_samples(): 136975000: noise_floor: -42.3 dBFS
```
- If you only see these lines and nothing else, it means there is no transmission on the configured
  channel - or there is, but it's not strong enough for the squelch to open. If you see a lot of
  other debug messages, that's good, they describe various stages of frame decoding and you
  can figure out, how it's doing and where it fails. However if the squelch opens all the time,
  several times a second and there are still no messages, it means your gain is probably set too
  high and the receiver front end is saturated. Reduce the gain a bit (like 1-2 dB) and see if
  it helps.

###### Tuned frequency has to be correct

- initially, just don't set it manually, use the default of 136.975 MHz.

###### PPM correction setting has to be accurate

- oscillators in cheap receivers are not 100% accurate. It is usually necessary to introduce
  manual correction to get precise tuning. There is no one-size-fits-all correction value - it is
  receiver-specific. See next question.

##### How do I estimate PPM correction value for my dongle?

**Method 1:** use `rtl_test` utility which comes with `librtlsdr` library. Run it with `-p` option and
observe the output:

        root@linux:~ # rtl_test -p

        real sample rate: 2048181 current PPM: 89 cumulative PPM: 80

After a couple of minutes the cumulative PPM value converges to a stable reading. This is
the value for your dongle. However, some people reported that this method is not always 100%
accurate, so it's good to double-check with method 2 or 3.

**Method 2:** use your favorite SDR console (like SDRSharp, HDSDR, GQRX, etc). Tune it to a
frequency of some local narrowband transmitter which transmits constantly (or very often) and
is driven by a good frequency reference. A good example is an ATIS or AWOS channel from a local
airport. Zoom in on the channel peak and adjust the correction value in the receiver settings
to bring the peak exactly to the tuned frequency. If it's a voice channel, judge it by your ear -
aim for the lowest possible background noise. See this video tutorial for reference:
[Frequency calibration in SDRSharp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFXMbr1dgng).

**Method 3:** use [kalibrate-rtl](https://github.com/steve-m/kalibrate-rtl) utility. It estimates
the correction value using GSM signal from nearby base stations. The estimate is quite accurate
provided that you supply the program with approximate PPM offset value using `-e` option. This
is even more important if your dongle has a large offset value (say, 50 or more).

##### What do these numbers in the message header mean?

        [2017-02-26 19:18:00 GMT] [136.975] [-18.9/-43.9 dBFS] [25.0 dB]

From left to right:

- date and time with timezone.

- channel frequency on which the message has been received.

- signal power level (averaged over transmitter ramp-up stage, ie. 3 symbol periods after
  squelch opening). Full scale is 0 dB.

- noise floor power level. Full scale is 0 dB.

- signal to noise ratio (ie. signal power level minus noise floor power level).

##### What do these cryptic codewords in CPDLC messages mean?

These are object names and type names from ICAO ASN.1 module which describe the abstract
syntax of CPDLC messages. Currently dumpvdl2 outputs the decoded ASN.1 structure with
a generic printing routine. It's not very pretty, but it can print every possible type
of message which complies to the standard.  For now it looks like this:

```
ATCUplinkMessage ::= {
    header: ATCMessageHeader ::= {
        messageIdNumber: 4
        dateTime: DateTimeGroup ::= {
            date: Date ::= {
                year: 2017
                month: 6
                day: 5
            }
            timehhmmss: Timehhmmss ::= {
                hoursminutes: Time ::= {
                    hours: 12
                    minutes: 28
                }
                seconds: 59
            }
        }
        logicalAck: 0
    }
    messageData: ATCUplinkMessageData ::= {
        elementIds: elementIds ::= {
            uM74Position: fixName: FixName ::= {
                name: MIKOV
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This is a message sent by ATC to the crew. There is a fix name (MIKOV) in the message data
section, but what's the actual clearance? To find out, look up the parameter name
`uM74Position` in `asn1/atn-cpdlc.asn1` file (in the dumpvdl2 source directory). The
meaning of each parameter is given in the comment preceding it:

```
    -- PROCEED DIRECT TO [position]
    -- Urg(N)/Alr(M)/Resp(W/U)
    uM74Position  [74] Position,
```
So the clearance is: "proceed direct to MIKOV". Simple as that.

Pretty-printing of these messages will be implemented in a future release of dumpvdl2.

##### Can you add support for [*my favourite SDR receiver type*]?

Maybe. However do not expect me to purchase all SDRs available on the market just to make
dumpvdl2 work with them. If your life absolutely depends on it, consider donating, or at least
lending me the hardware for some time for development and testing.

Alternatively, if you can write code, you may do the work by yourself and submit it as a pull
request. Most of the program code is hardware-agnostic anyway. Adding new device type basically
comes down to the following:

- `dumpvdl2.c`, `dumpvdl2.h` - add new input type and necessary command line options.

- `rtl.c`, `rtl.h` - this is the code specific to the RTLSDR hardware. Make a copy and modify
  it to use the API of your SDR device. Or you can start off from `mirics.c` and `mirics.h`,
  if you prefer.

- `demod.c` - if your SDR device uses a sample format other than 8-bit unsigned and 16-bit
  signed, it is necessary to write a routine which handles this format and converts the samples
  to signed float in the <-1;1> range. Refer to `process_buf_uchar()` and `process_buf_short()`
  routines for details.

- `Makefile` - add new WITH_*DEVICE* compile time option and your new source files, add
  necessary `LDLIBS`, etc.

##### Can you add support for Windows?

To be honest, I don't use Windows very often and I don't know the programming intricacies of
this OS. However, if you feel like you could port the code and maintain the port later on,
please do so. Pull requests welcome.
